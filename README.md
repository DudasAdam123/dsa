- The first 4 lines of code, are about which folders of c# we want to incule id the program.
- The next 3 lines are about, what the program is called, what class is it in etc...
- The next line asks you to type in a number, and then the line after that, reads in the number you just typed in.
  This process will repeat in the following two lines of code.
- Finally the program adds the two numbers together.
- The last line of code, is just another input asking line, for the program to not close immediately.
